One problem...

It doesn't work yet!

### Your Task

Add functionality in `script.js` for the `filterData` function to work as expected.

To see if it truly works, head to `/test.html` and press the `Run Test` button, to you know... run the tests. If it passes, you're all good. If not... well, keep at it.
